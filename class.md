**What is a Class?**
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess. A class serves as a blueprint from which multiple objects can be created.

**Defining a Class:**
To define a class in PHP, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Here's an example:

```php
class Car {
    // Properties (attributes)
    public $brand;
    public $color;
    
    // Methods (behaviors)
    public function startEngine() {
        echo "Engine started!";
    }
    
    public function drive() {
        echo "Driving...";
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a `Car` class with two properties (`$brand` and `$color`) and two methods (`startEngine()` and `drive()`).

**Creating Objects (Instances):**
Once a class is defined, you can create objects (also known as instances) of that class. Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and parentheses. Here's an example:

```php
$myCar = new Car();
```

In this example, we create a new `Car` object and assign it to the variable `$myCar`.

**Accessing Properties and Methods:**
To access the properties and methods of an object, you use the object name followed by the arrow (`->`) operator. Here's an example:

```php
$myCar->brand = "Toyota";
$myCar->color = "Blue";

echo $myCar->brand;  // Output: Toyota

$myCar->startEngine();  // Output: Engine started!
```

In this example, we set the `brand` and `color` properties of the `$myCar` object and then access and display the `brand` property using `echo`. We also call the `startEngine()` method of the `$myCar` object.

**Constructor Method:**
A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It allows you to initialize the object's properties or perform any other necessary setup. The constructor method in PHP is named `__construct()`. Here's an example:

```php
class Car {
    public $brand;
    public $color;
    
    public function __construct($brand, $color) {
        $this->brand = $brand;
        $this->color = $color;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class has a constructor method that accepts `$brand` and `$color` as parameters. It initializes the object's `brand` and `color` properties with the provided values.

**Inheritance:**
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. The class being inherited from is called the parent or base class, and the class inheriting from it is called the child or derived class. The child class can add its own properties and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class. Here's an example:

```php
class SportsCar extends Car {
    public function boost() {
        echo "Speeding up!";
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SportsCar` class is a child class of the `Car` class. It inherits the `brand` and `color` properties as well as the `startEngine()` method from the `Car` class. Additionally, it defines its own method `boost()`.

**Visibility:**
In PHP, properties and methods can have different visibility levels, which control their accessibility from outside the class. The three visibility modifiers

 are:
- `public`: The property or method is accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
- `protected`: The property or method is accessible only within the class and its child classes.
- `private`: The property or method is accessible only within the class itself.

Here's an example:

```php
class Car {
    public $brand;  // Public property
    protected $color;  // Protected property
    private $engineStatus;  // Private property
    
    public function startEngine() {  // Public method
        $this->engineStatus = "on";
        echo "Engine started!";
    }
    
    protected function repaint($newColor) {  // Protected method
        $this->color = $newColor;
        echo "Car repainted to $newColor!";
    }
    
    private function checkEngineStatus() {  // Private method
        echo "Engine status: $this->engineStatus";
    }
}
```
